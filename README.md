Flask App Hosted on GCP

Created a web-based app that will be used to streamline the dental referral process at the Ashland Free Medical Clinic. The app has create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) capabilities and was built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Python.

The app was deployed to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with a CI/CD pipeline established between Github, Docker, Cloudbuild, Container Registry, and Cloud Run.
